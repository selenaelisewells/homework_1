			<h1>Information about my current life</h1>

				How you know from my heading, my name is Vika. I'm 18 years old. I lived in Ukraine, but I moved in London, Ontario, Canada. That my first experience to live in another country alone without any of my relatives. I've thought it would be so hard and also, confusing, but frankly, everything is not so bad. I've already met new people who I can even call my friends. In addition, finally I've figured out how to stop a bus in Canada , because other times I usually skipped my bus stop and that was so weird, but anyway I could overcome that. Also, I really like the programme which I've chosen. As far as, I didn't expected that it would be so interesting and funny. I'm really lucky oersone for that moment.

				So, before I've moved to Canada, I was working as a barista in "Bull_Kava". It was really cool time. Also, in summer I was working as a camper in ukrainian camp which is called "Day camp in Study Academy". Sometimes working there was really complicating, but I got new  experience and improved my English as well. In summery, I'm glad that I'm in Canada and studying in Fanshawe college.
